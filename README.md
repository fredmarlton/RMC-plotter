# RMC-plotter
A simple module for plotting results from big box modelling in RMCProfile in Python.
I found this very useful for viewing my fits with their partials and the chi2.
The RMC_plotter.py script can be saved to any directory and the example shows how the module can be run in a python script.

Here's an example of how it looks from one of the tutorials:

NOTE: The chi2 results are blank in this case and may not work for the older versions of RMCProfile

Feel free to make your own edits or let me know if there's any issues or requests.
Happy RMC-ing!
